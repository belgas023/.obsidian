Hello, 
My name is CÃ´me and today i will present to you a bit about myself.
I'm 17 years old i live in Paris since I'm born. I go to high school SMP where I'm currently in final grade.
I really like geopolitics class, and computer science class. Fortunately because it take 50% of my time... 
In my spare time il like to play video games, coding silly and useless things that make me laugh _basically_, but also i climb a lot, and draw a lot.
In the future i would like to work in something related either to computer science or history. And hopefully somewhere i can express in a way or an other some creativity.
To conclude i will say that im a curious person,maybe a little shy, but definitely ready overcome it and become better at english.
